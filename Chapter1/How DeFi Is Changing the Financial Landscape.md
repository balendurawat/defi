Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the traditional central landscape in several ways. Here are some of the key ways in which DeFi is disrupting the centralized financial system:

1.) Decentralization-: DeFi is built on a decentralized infrastructure that does not rely on intermediaries or middlemen to facilitate transactions. This means that the power is shifted away from central authorities and distributed across the network, creating a more democratic and transparent financial system.DeFi is enabling financial transactions without intermediaries, reducing the need for central authorities to regulate financial activities. DeFi is built on a decentralized architecture, which eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks and other financial institutions. This means that financial transactions can be conducted directly between two parties, without the need for a middleman. This reduces costs and increases efficiency. This is achieved by using smart contracts to automate financial transactions, removing the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers to facilitate transactions.
2.) Accessibility-: Traditional finance is often exclusive, with high barriers to entry that limit access to financial services for many people. DeFi, on the other hand, is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, providing financial services to underserved communities around the world
3.) Transparency-: DeFi transactions are transparent and verifiable on the blockchain, making it easy to audit and track financial activities. This level of transparency increases trust and reduces the risk of fraud or corruption. DeFi is built on a transparent blockchain infrastructure, which allows anyone to track and verify transactions. This ensures that financial transactions are transparent and accountable.
4.) Interoperability-: DeFi protocols are interoperable, meaning that they can work seamlessly with each other, creating a cohesive and interconnected financial ecosystem. This allows for greater innovation and collaboration in the development of new financial products and services.
5.) Control-: DeFi gives users greater control over their financial assets, allowing them to hold, transfer, and invest their funds without relying on centralized authorities. This control is enhanced by the use of smart contracts, which execute automatically when specific conditions are met, reducing the need for human intervention.
6.) Programmability-: DeFi allows for the creation of programmable financial instruments, such as smart contracts. This enables the automation of financial processes and eliminates the need for human intervention.
7.) Innovation-: DeFi is a hotbed of innovation, with new financial products and services being developed regularly. This creates opportunities for new players to enter the market and disrupt the traditional financial sector.
